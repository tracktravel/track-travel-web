            "description": "A new generation of programmers is usually driven by the idea of getting a first job at an established company. This story is not very different from many others in that sense. Several of us, current members of Track Travel, went through experiences of this style in already established companies and we were rescuing work methodologies and experiences necessary to carry out this particular project. Our history does not date back many years, but proudly unites a lot of energy with individual wills to provide you with the best possible service. Just a few months ago we started to ally ourselves with a common goal of improvement and learning. Today we are constantly working on a practical and punctual solution for all the travel agencies in the world. Yes, the world. And we proudly carry all this ambition forward. The idea was born in Rio de Janeiro, after observing multiple agencies with day-to-day management problems, we conducted a deeper study of these shortcomings and began to form our team. Some of us are friends from our studies, others are recent graduates from a common programming school, and regardless of our origins, we share the same enthusiasm. Our story may be quite different from the storytelling that we usually see written in an endless number of projects and websites. We don't need to lie. Our product will speak for itself with all its qualities generated by this genuine and persistent group."
